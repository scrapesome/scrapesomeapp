## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install scrapesome
```


## Playwright Setup

ScrapeSome uses Playwright for JavaScript rendering fallback. To enable this, you need to install Playwright and its dependencies.

### 1. Install Playwright Python package if not installed

```bash
pip install playwright
```

### 2. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
playwright install
```
### 3. Install system dependencies
Playwright requires some system libraries to run browsers, which vary by operating system.

For Windows
Playwright installs everything you need automatically with playwright install, so no additional setup is usually required.

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
Run the following command to install required system libraries:

```bash
playwright install-deps
```
If you don't have playwright CLI available, you can install dependencies manually:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libwoff1 libopus0 libwebp6 libharfbuzz-icu0 libwebpmux3 \
                        libenchant-2-2 libhyphen0 libegl1 libglx0 libgudev-1.0-0 \
                        libevdev2 libgles2 libx264-160
```
Note: Package names may vary depending on your distribution and version.

For macOS
You can install required libraries using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install harfbuzz enchant
```

After this setup, you should be able to use ScrapeSome with full Playwright rendering support!

## ⚡ Quick Start
Synchronous Example

```python
from scrapesome import sync_scraper
html = sync_scraper("https://example.com")
html
```


Asynchronous Example

```python
import asyncio
from scrapesome import async_scraper
html = asyncio.run(async_scraper("https://example.com"))
html
```
## 🖥️ CLI Usage

ScrapeSome also includes a powerful CLI for quick and easy scraping from the command line.

### 📦 Installation with CLI Support

To use the CLI, install with the optional `cli` extras:

```bash
pip install scrapesome[cli]
```

### 🔧 Basic Usage

```bash
scrapesome scrape --url https://example.com
```
This performs a synchronous scrape and outputs plain text by default.

### ⚙️ Available Options
| Option             | Description                               | Default |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--async-mode`     | Use asynchronous scraping                  | False   |
| `--force-playwright`| Force JavaScript rendering using Playwright | False   |
| `--output-format`  | Choose `text`, `json`, `markdown`, or `html` | html    |


### Examples

#### Basic scrape
```bash
scrapesome scrape --url https://example.com
```

#### Force Playwright rendering
```bash
scrapesome scrape --url https://example.com --force-playwright
```

#### Get JSON output
```bash
scrapesome scrape --url https://example.com --output-format json
```

#### Async scrape with markdown output
```bash
scrapesome scrape --url https://example.com --async-mode --output-format markdown
```

## 🧰 Advanced Usage

Force Rendering (Playwright)

```python
from scrapesome import sync_scraper
content = sync_scraper("https://example.com", force_playwright=True)
content
```

Custom User Agents

```python
from scrapesome import sync_scraper
content = sync_scraper("https://example.com", user_agents=["MyCustomAgent/1.0"])
content
```

Control Redirects

```python
from scrapesome import sync_scraper
content = sync_scraper("https://example.com", allow_redirects=False)
content
```

similarly **async_scraper** can also be used.

## 🧪 Testing
Run tests with:

```bash
pytest --cov=scrapesome tests/
```
Target coverage: 75–100%

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration
ScrapeSome reads from environment variables if a .env file is present.

Example .env

```env
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
OUTPUT_FORMAT=text
FETCH_PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=10
FETCH_PAGE_TIMEOUT=10
USER_AGENTS=["Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)......."]
```

| Key                      | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| FETCH_PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT | Timeout for Playwright-rendered pages (in seconds)  |
| FETCH_PAGE_TIMEOUT       | Timeout for standard page fetch (in seconds)        |
| LOG_LEVEL                | Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, etc.)      |
| OUTPUT_FORMAT            | Default output format (text, markdown, json, html)  |
| USER_AGENTS              | Default user agents ("Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64).......")  |

## 📄 Output Formats

JSON Example

Get `json` version

```python
from scrapesome import sync_scraper
content = sync_scraper("https://example.com", output_format_type="json")
content
```

Output

```json
{
  "title": "Example Domain",
  "description": "This domain is for use in illustrative examples.",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```
